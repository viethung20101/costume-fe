# CC/iC Unity Tools (All Pipelines)

Read Me
=======

Welcome to the [Unity](https://www.unity.com/) import and auto setup tool for **Character Creator 3**, **Character Creator 4**, **iClone 7** and **iClone 8** from [Reallusion](https://www.reallusion.com/).

This is a fully featured tool to take exports from CC/iClone and set them up in Unity with complete visual fidelity. *This version is for all Unity versions 2020.3 and upwards and for all pipelines*.

The tool can produce characters of the highest visual quality using custom Shadergraph shaders.
Additionally, more performance focussed characters can be produced using simpler shaders with a minimal loss of visual quality.

Progress and additional information can be found in the [Reallusion forum thread](https://discussions.reallusion.com/t/unity-auto-setup/12570) and the [legacy forum thread](https://forum.reallusion.com/488356/Unity-Auto-Setup)

How it works
============

Character exports from Character Creator and iClone can be dragged into Unity, the import tool can then be opened and the character processed with a single click.

For full details of the workflow, see the [documentation](https://soupday.github.io/cc_unity_tools/).
